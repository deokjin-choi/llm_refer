# llm_refer

This repository is a practical reference guide for using Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world decision-making, especially in the context of technology and patent analysis.

---

## What is this repository?

`llm_refer` is a structured collection of insights, prompt templates, decision rules, and analysis frameworks developed through real conversations between a strategist (me) and an AI assistant (귀남이).

The focus is on how to use LLMs not just to generate content, but to support:

- Patent comparison and analysis
- Technology positioning
- Implementation-level differentiation
- Strategic direction setting
- Prompt design for consistent and explainable judgment

---

## Why does it exist?

Many users know what information they have, but not how to turn it into structured insight using LLMs.  
This repository captures techniques for asking the right questions, setting judgment criteria, and guiding LLMs to generate actionable outputs.

It includes:

- Reusable prompt templates
- Evaluation logic (e.g., majority-rule for high-level comparison)
- Multi-layered analysis frameworks
- Practical lessons and prompts derived from real use cases

## Repository Structure

| Folder / File | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `prompts/`    | Prompt templates for each analysis layer (positioning, differentiation, strategy) |
| `insights/`   | Notes and distilled tips from actual LLM-based decision support |
| `docs/`       | Conceptual guides (e.g., how to turn information into structured questions) |
| `README.md`   | Overview of the project and how to use it |
